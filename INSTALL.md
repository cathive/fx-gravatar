To build and install the fx-gravatar library you'll need the following tools and
dependencies:

* Java Development Kit (Version 7.0 / 1.7.0 or higher)
* JavaFX Runtime (Version 2.x), might be bundled with your JDK
* Maven (Version 3.0.3 and 3.0.4 have both been tested)

Usually all you need to do to build and install fx-gravatar into your local .m2
repository should be the execution of the following Maven command line:

```sh
mvn install
```
